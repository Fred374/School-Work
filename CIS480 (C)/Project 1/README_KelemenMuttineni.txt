There are no known issues with the code, though testing has been done only with one case
it was done several times to ensure correctness. The code works with the following mips
commands

add
sub
sll
srl
slt
addi
lui
ori
lw
sw

Rudimentary implementation of beq,bne, and j, I'm not sure if they actually produce the 
correct outputs, but it should take them as inputs without throwing and error.

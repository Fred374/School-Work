<h3>
	1.	if det(A) != 0 then a is invertible as it’s linearly independent. <br>
	For 2*2 invertible matrix A^-1 = 1/ad—bc* [d -b | -c a] (using | as a line split)<br><br>
	
	2. for every two points take the area of the triangle formed by them and the point you want to check.<br> 
	If the area of all triangles have the same sign the orientation is the same and the point is inside.<br>
	For a polygon you draw a rightward line from the point if it intersects with polygon lines an even<br>
	number of times it’s outside, else it’s inside.<br><br>
	
	3. area2 finds the area of a rectangle using AC’s length and BC’s height then subtracts the area of<br>
	the rectangle using BC’s length and AC’s height. Three applications are finding the area of a triangle<br>
	and by extension any polygon, finding if a point is inside a triangle, and determining the orientation<br>
	of a triangle.<br><br>

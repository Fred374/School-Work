<h3>
	1.  Act consistently with the public interest.<br>
		Act consistently with the interests of their employer or client.<br>
		Ensure products meet the highest professional standards possible.<br>
		Maintain integrity and independence in professional judgement.<br>
		Managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical <br>
		approach to management of software development and maintenance.<br>
		Act fair and supportive of colleagues.<br>
		<br>
	2. As professional engineers can have a great effect on the health and <br>
		wellbeing of the public it is reasonable that engineers should be <br>
		certified like doctors and lawyers.<br>
		<br>
	3.  Four attributes important for professional software are maintainability,<br>
		dependability, security, and efficiency. Other important attributes are <br>
		reusability, portability, correctness and applicability.<br>
		<br>
	4.  User requirements are important because they are what the customer wants<br>
		from the software, as compared to system requirements which are what is<br>
		necessary for the system to run.<br>
		<br>
	5.  Another challenge software engineers will face in the 21st century is <br>
		the increased power required by computers, as computers get better they<br>
		require more power to run and as code is used for more, the computers <br>
		need to be better, thus presenting an environmental issue.<br>
		<br>
	6.  Anti-lock braking should be made with the plan-driven method as it's a <br>
		system that should work as a whole.<br>
		A virtual reality system should be made with an agile method because <br>
		most of it's functions will be smaller and better written piece by piece.<br>
		A university accounting system should be made with an agile method<br>
		because it will better support the many small functions necessary for<br>
		an accounting system.<br>

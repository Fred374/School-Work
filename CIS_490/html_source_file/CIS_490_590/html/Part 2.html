<h4>Part 2</h4>
<p> <h5>
I'm a computer science senior. My goal for this class is to pass as I'm hopefully <br>
in my last semester. I have all the standard course work for a CS major and so <br>
have a good understanding of C and java. I've also used C#, VB, and android studio<br>
in my internships over the past few years. The only HTML I've used has been in <br>
other classes taught by professor Essa.

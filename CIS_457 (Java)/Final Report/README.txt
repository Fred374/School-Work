THE CODE DOES NOT WORK

Both choosey.java and C4.java can be compiled and run.
choosey.java will display an array of squares that would
have made up the game board.
C4.java will run a connect 4 game, inputs are the numbers 
1 through 7 each corresponding to a column.
Connect4.java compiles but does not run correctly, it will
display the board but doesn't take input.
